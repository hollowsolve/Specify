# Interactive Refinement Loop - Phase 3

The Interactive Refinement Loop is the user-facing layer of the Specify system that presents findings, gets approval, and iterates. It implements a sophisticated human-in-the-loop system that makes specification refinement feel like collaborating with a senior architect.

## Overview

Phase 3 takes the `RefinedSpecification` from Phase 2 and orchestrates a presentation → feedback → iteration cycle until the user is satisfied. The result is a `FinalizedSpecification` ready for execution planning in Phase 4.

## Key Features

### 🤝 **Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration**
- Interactive review of edge cases, contradictions, and completeness gaps
- Smart auto-accept for high-confidence, low-impact changes
- Batch processing for similar suggestions
- Session save/resume capability

### 🎨 **Rich User Experience**
- Beautiful CLI interface using Rich library
- Color-coded findings by priority and confidence
- Progress tracking across iterations
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### 🧠 **Intelligent Suggestions**
- LLM-powered context-aware recommendations
- Pattern-based suggestion generation
- Confidence scoring and impact assessment
- Smart ranking by value and effort

### 📊 **Export & Documentation**

## Core Components

### RefinementLoop
The main orchestrator that:
- Manages the presentation → feedback → iteration cycle
- Tracks refinement history and user decisions
- Detects convergence (when user is satisfied)
- Handles session persistence and resumability

### FindingPresenter
Rich formatting engine that:
- Presents edge cases in actionable format
- Shows contradictions with clear explanations
- Displays completeness gaps with priority
- Exports findings in multiple formats

### SuggestionGenerator
LLM-powered suggestion engine that:
- Analyzes edge cases and suggests handling strategies
- Proposes resolutions for contradictions
- Recommends specific requirements for gaps
- Ranks suggestions by confidence and impact

### ApprovalHandler
Interactive decision workflow that:
- Presents suggestions with rich formatting
- Collects user decisions (accept/reject/modify/custom)
- Supports batch operations for efficiency
- Tracks acceptance patterns and preferences

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Start new refinement session
specify refine specification.json

# Resume existing session
specify resume <session-id>

# List all sessions
specify sessions

# Export finalized specification
specify export <session-id> --format markdown
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from refinement import RefinementLoop, FindingPresenter, SuggestionGenerator, ApprovalHandler

# Initialize components
presenter = FindingPresenter()
suggestion_generator = SuggestionGenerator()
approval_handler = ApprovalHandler()

# Create refinement loop
refinement_loop = RefinementLoop(
    presenter=presenter,
    suggestion_generator=suggestion_generator,
    approval_handler=approval_handler
)

# Start refinement
finalized_spec = refinement_loop.start_refinement(refined_spec)
```

## Data Models

### RefinementSession
Tracks the entire refinement journey:
- `session_id`: Unique identifier
- `original_spec`: Input from Phase 2
- `iterations`: List of refinement rounds
- `user_decisions`: All user choices
- `current_state`: Evolving specification state
- `finalized_spec`: Final approved specification

### UserDecision
Records individual user choices:
- `suggestion_id`: Which suggestion this addresses
- `action`: accept/reject/modify/custom/clarify
- `reasoning`: User's explanation
- `modification`: Details if modified
- `custom_content`: User-added content

### FinalizedSpecification
The refined, approved output:
- `requirements`: All approved requirements
- `resolved_edge_cases`: Edge cases with handling
- `confidence_score`: Overall quality metric
- `user_acceptance_rate`: How many suggestions were accepted
- `ready_for_dispatch`: Boolean indicating execution readiness

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **User Experience First**
- Fast, intuitive, non-annoying interface
- Smart defaults to minimize decision fatigue
- Clear visual hierarchy and progress indicators
- Respect user time and preferences

### 2. **Intelligent Automation**
- Auto-accept high-confidence, low-impact changes
- Batch similar suggestions for efficiency
- Learn from user patterns within session
- Provide context-aware recommendations

### 3. **Transparency & Control**
- Show confidence scores and reasoning
- Allow modification of any suggestion
- Provide detailed explanations when requested
- Export comprehensive decision history

### 4. **Resumability & Persistence**
- Save session state automatically
- Allow breaks and resumption
- Track long-term refinement history
- Support collaborative refinement

## Suggestion Generation Patterns

The system recognizes common patterns and provides intelligent suggestions:

### Edge Case Handling
- **Null/Empty Values**: Validation and default mechanisms
- **Boundary Conditions**: Input validation and limits
- **Concurrency Issues**: Synchronization and locking
- **Network Problems**: Timeouts, retries, circuit breakers
- **User Input**: Comprehensive validation and sanitization

### Contradiction Resolution
- **Priority Hierarchy**: Establish clear precedence rules
- **Configurable Balance**: Allow runtime trade-off adjustments
- **Role-Based**: Different requirements for different users
- **Conditional Logic**: Context-sensitive application

### Completeness Improvements
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption
- **Performance**: Scalability and response time requirements
- **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, alerting

## Export Formats

### JSON
Structured data suitable for programmatic consumption:
```json
{
  "requirements": [...],
  "confidence_score": 0.85,
  "user_acceptance_rate": 0.78,
  "execution_readiness": {...}
}
```

### Markdown
Human-readable documentation:
```markdown
# Finalized Specification

**Confidence Score:** 85%
**User Acceptance Rate:** 78%

## Requirements (15)
1. User must be able to authenticate...
```

### YAML
Configuration-friendly format:
```yaml
requirements:
  - type: functional
    content: "User must be able to..."
    priority: high
```

## Session Management

### Session Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: New session with unique ID
2. **Iteration**: Multiple rounds of review and refinement
3. **Convergence**: System detects user satisfaction
4. **Finalization**: User confirms completion
5. **Export**: Output in desired format

### Persistence
- Sessions automatically saved to `~/.specify/sessions/`
- JSON format with complete state
- Resumable at any point
- Exportable history and metrics

### Convergence Detection
The system detects when refinement is complete based on:
- High user acceptance rate (>95%)
- Few remaining unresolved issues
- User satisfaction indicators
- Manual confirmation

## Quality Metrics

### Confidence Score
Calculated from:
- User acceptance rate (30% weight)
- Iteration quality bonus (20% weight)
- Remaining issues penalty (50% weight)

### Execution Readiness
Assessed by:
- Completeness of requirements
- Resolution of contradictions
- Edge case handling coverage
- Overall confidence level

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Auto-save on interruption
- Clear error messages
- Recovery suggestions
- Session state preservation

### User Support
- Detailed help text
- Example-driven guidance
- Progressive disclosure
- Undo/redo capabilities

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Start with high-priority suggestions** - Address critical issues first
2. **Use batch mode for similar items** - Save time on repetitive decisions
3. **Provide reasoning for rejections** - Helps improve future suggestions
4. **Take breaks** - Sessions are fully resumable
5. **Export early and often** - Preserve your work

### For Integrators
1. **Validate input specifications** - Ensure Phase 2 output is well-formed
2. **Configure user preferences** - Set appropriate defaults
3. **Monitor session metrics** - Track user satisfaction trends
4. **Implement feedback loops** - Use session data to improve suggestions
5. **Provide clear documentation** - Help users understand the process
